## Markov Models

Four common Markov models [1]		

|                      | System state is fully observable |         System state is partially observable         |
| :------------------: | :------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| System is autonomous |           Markov chain           |                 Hidden Markov model                  |
| System is controlled |  Markov decision process (MDP)   | Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) |
